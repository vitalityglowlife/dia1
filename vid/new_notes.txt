##### earlier instructions #####
 Campaign 1 – Phase 1 - x-mode only
	Ad1 <$20.
	Ad2 <$20
	Ad3 <$20
For example, if CPC is over $2.50 @ $10 = Pause
Determine which of the three is the best video. If none of the videos meet the minimum KPIs of CPC < $1.50, CTR >1.50%, CPM > $10, View Rate > 20%, then you must continue to create and/or modify scripts until you reach these minimum KPIs.
Then pick the best KPIs/script and move to Phase 2.
Phase 2 – Hook Phase
Prepare 5 additional hooks.  These hooks should be congruent with the script you moved forward with from Phase 1.
Hook Testing = Test one at time.
Test each hook to $20,  If you are < $2/CPC and >1.50%CTR, keep running to $50.  Now at $50 you want KPIs of <$1.50/CPC and >2.0%/CTR, if those numbers are met, keep running to 1x AOV (Average Order Value).
Hedge our bet….by monitoring the engagements inside ClickMagick.
We would like to see for every $20 to $30 spent in ad spend = 1 engagement because we know on average, we get one sale for every 3-4  engagements.
Phase 3 – Opening scenes
Prepare a minimum of 5 unique opening scenes.

Campaign 1 – Phase 1:
	Ad1 <$20.
	Ad2 <$20
	Ad3 <$20

CPC too high?  If CPC is over $3.50 @ $10 = Pause
Once each ad has run up to $20, determine which of the three is the best video.
Then pick the best of the three and move to Phase 2.

Phase 2 – Opening Scenes
Prepare a minimum of 5 opening scens (you can test more as needed).  Test a combination of AI generated scenes and UGC.


Scenes = Test one at time. Follow the following instructions when assessing KPIs and deciding what NEXT action to take:

When the ad reaches $20 in ad spend:  If <$2/CPC &  >1.50%CTR, let it keep running to the $50 ad spend mark.

When the ad reaches $50, reassess the numbers:  If <$1.50/CPC and >2.0%/CTR, let it keep running to 1x Average Order Value (you find the AOV inside the Clickbank Marketplace).

When the ad spend get's to 1x AOV we are looking for a minimum of one sale.

I hedge not over-spending my ad budget by also monitoring the engagements inside ClickMagick.  At $20-$30 I am looking for  = 1 engagement because we know on average, we get one sale for every 3-4  engagements.

If we don’t find our winner in Phase 2, pick the best scene with the best stats and move to Phase 3

Phase 3 – Hooks Scenes
The hooks you test are to be congruent with the base video.  These hooks will be used on the best performing ad from Phase 2.
Prepare a minimum of 5 unique hooks (you can test more as needed).

I want you to put the most weight on your CPC and your ACR.  If you have a 1.7% CTR but CPC is under $1.50 and ACR is above 50%, I would let it keep running if that was me.  Make note of what I told you above regarding engagements too.


################ spending issues ################
If the ad spend is not spending, we need to keep testing.  If this was me, I would be testing new UGC, new scenes, new hooks.  Do not wait for the ad to spend in this case (unless it is a new campaign, which yours is not a new campaign) because I have found when it doesn't spend it is because there is something Google doesn't like.


If spend issues persist, we have two choices...  #1  We can continue to increase the Tcpa in $10 increments (no more than five times in a day) or #2 We can switch from theTcpa bidding strategy to the Max Conversion bidding strategy.

I like the idea of starting a new campaign but you still may need to raise the Tcpa if we have spend issues.  Often if spend issues continue, I swith over to maximum conversion.  Take note of this should we need to switch over.
